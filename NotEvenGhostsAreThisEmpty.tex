\title{Not Even Ghosts Are This Empty}
\maketitle
Can I ever get a moment to \textcolor{red}{myself}? \\
Each moment that passes is \textcolor{blue}{fleeting} \\
I try and I try to escape my own life \\
At this point y'all should call me \textcolor{red}{Houdini} (Oddy, don't!) \\
It always ends up with me \textcolor{green}{bleeding} \\
Or so overwhelming I'm \textcolor{blue}{retreating} \\
Back into the hole that I climb out of \\
It always ends up \textcolor{green}{self-defeating} \\
I'm addicted to sex, addicted to \textcolor{magenta}{drugs} \\
Really whatever will make me feel \textcolor{magenta}{loved} \\
I don't care what you \textcolor{cyan}{thinking} \\
Yeah, I don't give a \textcolor{cyan}{fuck} \\
I'm still out here shinin' as bright as the \textcolor{yellow}{sun} \\
And no matter how hard it gets \\
No matter how \textcolor{orange}{tough} \\
Don't disobey when I say, "Give me the \textcolor{orange}{gun}" (give me the gun) \\
If I don't let my demons out to \textcolor{purple}{breathe} \\
I'll end up with some horns or a pair of fucking \textcolor{purple}{wings} \\
Come and visit me from \textcolor{brown}{time} to \textcolor{brown}{time} (from time to time) \\
To all them bitches I was ever with \\
Yeah, you're still on my \textcolor{brown}{mind} (mind-mind) \\

Huh, huh, aye \\
Yeah, pushing the coupe in the \textcolor{pink}{rain} (north!) \\
Think I been going \textcolor{pink}{insane} (side!) \\
Popping and smoking and \textcolor{gray}{drinking} (north!) \\
This how I been coping and dealing with \textcolor{gray}{pain} (side!) \\
Snort up a line with my \textcolor{darkgreen}{Mom}, yeah (north!) \\
I just be hoping to \textcolor{darkgreen}{bond} (side!) \\
Another day working and wasting \textcolor{darkred}{away} (north!) \\
The exact thing that I wanna \textcolor{darkred}{buy} (side!) \\
That's \textcolor{darkred}{time}, yeah \\
I'm in the Double R \\
Falling the fuck \textcolor{teal}{apart} \\
Cooking up my frontal \textcolor{violet}{lobe} \\
Play it strong on the \textcolor{violet}{phone} \\
But I cry \textcolor{violet}{alone} \\
'Cause my daddy just hit a new \textcolor{teal}{low} \\
Fuck \\
Everyday bad \textcolor{olive}{news}, everyday cash \textcolor{olive}{rules} \\
Fuck what I did (let's go!) \\
It's what have you done \textcolor{lightblue}{lately} \\
Fuck that poetic \textcolor{lightblue}{shit} \\
Got a chrome metal stick up to my brain, just to know heaven for a \textcolor{lightblue}{bit} (go, go, go) \\
I just want to run \textcolor{gold}{away} (away) \\
But all I ever do is run in \textcolor{gold}{place} (in place) \\
The tears I cried it could've iced my \textcolor{silver}{chain} (my chain) \\
And on the best days I can't feel my \textcolor{silver}{face} (my face) \\
No matter how hard it gets \\
No matter how \textcolor{orange}{tough} \\
My face, my \textcolor{silver}{face} \\
I can't feel my \textcolor{silver}{face} \\
No matter how hard it gets \\
No matter how \textcolor{orange}{tough} \\
My face, my \textcolor{silver}{face} \\
I can't feel my \textcolor{silver}{face} \\
My face, my \textcolor{silver}{face} \\
I can't feel my \textcolor{silver}{face} \\
No matter how hard it gets \\
No matter how \textcolor{orange}{tough} \\
My face, my \textcolor{silver}{face} \\
I can't
